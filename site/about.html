      <h1>About Roger</h1>

      <p>Roger Ellingson has led a complex life, with an unusual number of jobs and roles. He’s full of contrasts, presenting himself humbly, but animated or argumentative when the need arises. He hasn’t lived an easy life, but it’s one he’s clearly proud of.

      <p>As a child, his home life and relationship with his parents was difficult. His grades tanked to the lower third of his class, and he was miserable. At age 16 he ran away from home. Caught and charged with truancy, he was almost sent to a reform school in Kearney, but his grandfather got him admitted to BoysTown.

      <p>BoysTown wasn’t easy either. The social environment was mean, the other kids were from similar rough circumstances. But he took vocational school alongside regular high school, and picked up valuable skills like television repair. He rose to 8th in his class of 110 kids, and earned himself a scholastic achievement award and a scholarship to Cornell University. Unfortunately, this scholarship still required a finanical statement from his father, who angrily rejected the idea, saying it was none of their business.

      <p>So Roger went to college on his own savings and work, but this only lasted a year. With the draft lottery looming near, he went from there into the Navy. He was a technician, and a good one. He went through “Afloat College Education” courses through the Navy, and was top of his class for electronics.

      <p>From the Navy, he went to Dana College for his remaining 3 years, working construction to pay his way through. While pursuing his degree in Math and Physics, he studied piano and did a piano recital, did set construction for the theatre, and built and donated a full, working harpsichord to the school.

      <p>From college he was hired into Northwestern Bell as a programmer. After Bell was broken up, he found work at Dynamics Research corporation way out in Massachusetts.

      <p>DRC, now part of Engility Holdings, was a government contractor, providing program, engineering, and lifecycle support, as well as IT modernization and various other services. Roger worked on their F-16 global database, harmonizing different kinds of data and improving processes that affected all F-16 schedules, parts, and repairs worldwide. At DRC, he presented four papers, creating a big shift each time in how databases are restructured, planned, and accessed. His fourth and final presentation for the company, SQL as a Second Language, marked his company’s transition into SQL and what we’d think of as modern practice.

      <p>After 17 years at DRC, he was laid off, and eventually moved back to Nebraska to get back on his feet with the help of his family. He worked everything from landscaping, to welding, to cattle herding, before finally settling into forklift maintenance at Tyson. His organization and consistency kept them running smoothly for five and a half years, at which point he retired.

      <p>Roger still keeps busy! He gardens, pursues math and music, and he’s remodeling a house. He loves cooking for his kids, is always a friend to his neighbors, and is always at the ready with a joke. With all the wild, weird, and wonderful things that have happened, it’s impossible to say what’s next, but one thing’s certain: this story’s not over yet.
