CSD340: Web Development
Module 7.2 Assignment: bioSite Development and GitHub Pages Deployment

=====================

Header and footer added, even though "header" is redundant around nav, and a biography doesn't really want a footer element.

Upgraded all images to figures. Note that there will be no alt text in captioned figures since screen readers would read out both (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/58468470 ).

Finally licked the ERD landing page issue - I realized I need a fixed aspect ratio, and then I realized I can use transform: skew() instead of rotate() to make it easier to eyeball the needed lengths along just one axis, and then tweak the skew angle, that cut the number of unknowns I had to fiddle with in half. I'd love something a little more semantic like a background SVG, but this is what we have in our toolkit *right now*. The only thing remaining is to add the crows-feet, which I think will be images in this case. I will swap the 1:many on About in the original diagram with a 1:1 just for correctness sake!

The card layout in Hobbies is really disappointing to me, but once again I think I've run up against the limits of CSS.

I will continue to tweak the nav css. While it's already reactive thanks to flex's lovely flex-wrap attribute, I'm really not happy with the actual results. Not sure if that's going to wind up being upgrading them to boxes, or centering the text, or spacing them evenly along their row, we'll figure it out as we go.

But by now, you should be able to see the entire vision as I set it out in the wireframe sketches.
