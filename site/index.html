CSD340: Web Development
Module 9.2 Assignment: bioSite Peer Review

=====================

This week I've had a chance to peek at the site on mobile and I *did not like what I see*. While I initially
designed it with flex so everything would be reactive *in theory*, in practice it was a mess. So I rewired it.
I added a viewport meta to prevent the browser from shrinking the page in extreme circumstances, and instead
ask it to let my layout do the work. And then I identified a few places where the layout was suboptimal and
added breakpoints for those specific elements.

I also finished the splash page finally. The diagonal lines on this page are a little magic - check for
the skew transform in the css! Not sure how the crow's feet work on all screens. Please let me know!
